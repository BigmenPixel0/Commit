# Contributions welcome

Gnomit is at a very early stage but I appreciate any contributions you may have.

1. Please open an issue to discuss the contribution/issue to see if it fits with the feature scope of the project.
2. Issue a pull request on [the Gnomit GitHub mirror](https://github.com/indie-mirror/gnomit) (preferred) or send a patch file to aral@ind.ie

Thanks!
