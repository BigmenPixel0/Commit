# Contributions welcome

Gnomit is at a very early stage but I appreciate any contributions you may have.

It would especially be great to start thinking about how to package Gnomit up for easier installation.

1. Please open an issue to discuss the contribution/issue to see if it fits with the feature scope of the project.
2. Issue a pull request on [the Gnomit GitHub mirror](https://github.com/indie-mirror/gnomit) (preferred) or send a patch file to aral@ind.ie

Thanks!
