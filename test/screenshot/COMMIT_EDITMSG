This is the commit title; it should be short. Commit will highlight if it exceeds 72 characters (customizable).

Everything after the first blank line is the commit description. It can be as long as you like.

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
